# OrgTracks: A Real-Time Interview Activities Tracker for the Membership Application Process of UPLB Student Organizations
Authors: John Heinrich B. Austria and Mylah Rystie U. Anacleto

Tracking the interview activities within the membership application process of student organizations using general-purpose tools adds unnecessary complexity to the overall process. The burden from the slow and inefficient process is usually carried by organization members and officers. OrgTracks aims to solve this by providing a dedicated system for tracking the interview activities for the membership application process of UPLB student organizations. The system was successfully developed using MongoDB, Express, Next.js, Node.js, and Socket.IO; and was deployed in the cloud for user testing and evaluation. Thirteen (13) user testers evaluated OrgTracks using the System Usability Scale (SUS), where the system obtained an average score of 79.23 concluding its usability for the target users.
