# Development Set-up

This system contains three codebases that make up the components of the project:
1. `orgtracks-api` - main HTTP and SocketIO server
2. `orgtracks-ui` - client-side web application
3. `osam-mock-server` - mock server for receiving data from OrgTracks server

Please see `README.md` inside each directory on detailed instructions on how to setup each project.
